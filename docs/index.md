# hsclient
A python client for interacting with HydroShare in an object oriented way.

## Jupyter Notebooks
HydroShare has a resource with example notebooks.  Click [here](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/7561aa12fd824ebb8edbee05af19b910/) then click the blue `Open with...` dropdown and select `Cuahsi Jupyterhub` to launch the notebooks into a Jupyter Environment to start using this project.


## Install the HydroShare Python Client
The HydroShare Python Client for HydroShare won't be installed by default, so it has to be installed first before you can work with it. Use the following command to install the Python Client from the GitHub repository. Eventually we will distribute this package via the Python Package Index (PyPi) so that it can be installed via pip from PyPi.

```bash
pip install hsclient
```
